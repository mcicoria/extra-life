##Rules

The Game of Life is a simple discrete simulation on a regular grid. It is governed by two rules:

1. An empty square "comes to life" if it is adjacent to exactly three live squares

2. A live square "dies" if it has less than two live neighbors, or more than three live neighbors

However, in this version of the problem, the grid is finite, and the cells "wrap around". That means that on an n-by-n grid, the nth cell is always neighbors with the first cell.
